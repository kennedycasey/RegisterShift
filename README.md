# RegisterShift

## Manual checks
* audio: concurrent speech, bad boundaries, environmental noise, other messy audio for prosody analyses
* transcripts: usage context (label vs. other)

## Potential analyses
* different types of shift trajectory: qualitatively different usage contexts? can linguistic factors predict differences in when the switch to ADS happens?
* lexical diversity: bias-corrected entropy, frame and slot measures, rare words
* finer-grained timescale: using multiple variants at the same time

## Other potential next steps
* experiment ideas: 
  * can kids reverse engineer novel diminuitives? 
  * are kids more willing to accept second label when different register-specific linguistic features are introduced?
* parent-report ideas:
  * overcome the limit of the CDI which glosses over a lot of lexical variation and ask what kids/parents say across a broad age range
