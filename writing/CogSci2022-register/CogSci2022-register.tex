\begin{abstract}
Child-directed speech (CDS) features words such as \emph{doggy},
\emph{night-night}, and \emph{tummy} that are rarely used in
adult-directed speech (ADS). Characterisitcs of CDS word forms, such as
reduplication and diminutivization, explain why they may be learned and
produced earlier by children. However, it is not yet clear how or when
children switch to using ADS equivalents---\emph{dog}, \emph{goodnight},
\emph{stomach}. Through analysis of transcripts from CHILDES and the
Language Development Project corpus, we show that children significantly
increase their production of ADS word forms across age, with the average
CDS-to-ADS transition point at 2.5 years. Many of the linguistic
features that distinguish CDS vs.~ADS registers (e.g., speech rate,
lexical complexity, etc.) similarly differentiate the local speech
contexts surrounding CDS vs.~ADS word forms. To test whether these
patterns in children's input\ldots classifier details\ldots Learners may
therefore be able to capitalize on these cues to support their discovery
of context-appropriate CDS/ADS pair use.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Across many cultures and languages, the speech addressed to children
sounds remarkably different from the speech addressed to adults (REFs).
When communicating with young children, adults often modify their
speaking style in ways that draw children's attention and support their
several aspects of their language learning (e.g., Nencheva, Piazza, \&
Lew-Williams, 2021; Rowe, 2008; Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012;
Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013). As a result, child-directed speech (CDS) is
differentiated from adult-directed speech at multiple linguistic levels,
including prosodic, lexical, and syntactic (Soderstrom, 2007).

\hypertarget{linguistic-features-of-child-directed-speech}{%
\subsection{Linguistic features of child-directed
speech}\label{linguistic-features-of-child-directed-speech}}

CDS is associated with higher overall pitch as well as greater
variability in pitch (Fernald, 1989; Vosoughi \& Roy, 2012). Vowels
(REF) and words (REF) in CDS are often lengthened, creating utterances
that are produced more slowly (REF) and that also include more pauses
(REF). At the lexical level, CDS typically includes more repetition
(\textbf{henning2005maternal?}), more words that children already know
(Foushee, Griffiths, \& Srinivasan, 2016), and register-specific words
(REFS). Syntactically, CDS is characterized as less complex than ADS.
CDS utterances are typically shorter (REF) and feature simpler
constructions (check and REF).

Even very young infants appear to pick up on differences between CDS and
ADS, as evidenced by their reliable preference for listening to CDS over
ADS (Cooper \& Aslin, 1990; ManyBabies, 2020). In addition to this
overall preference for CDS, accumulating evidence points to children's
ability to distinguish individual linguistic features (REFS).

\hypertarget{social-context-of-child-directed-speech}{%
\subsection{Social context of child-directed
speech}\label{social-context-of-child-directed-speech}}

Linguistic cues are not the only distinguishing features between CDS and
ADS. For instance\ldots examples like acoustic, maybe affect (if there's
a ref that separates this from prosodic), and, most notably, social
(Golinkoff, Can, Soderstrom, \& Hirsh-Pasek, 2015). BLABLABLA kids are
linking linguistic and social information. Infants as young as 12 to 20
months show an emerging understanding of the relationship between
registers and addressees (\textbf{soley2020infants?};
\textbf{ikeda2018sensitivity?}). That is, CDS should be directed to
young children, not adults. Possibly a few other examples.

\hypertarget{the-current-study}{%
\subsection{The current study}\label{the-current-study}}

Here, we ask whether children may also be able to learn more subtle
associations between words and registers. We return to examination of a
specific lexical modification of CDS: the inclusion of register-specific
words, such as \emph{doggy}, \emph{night-night}, and \emph{tummy}.

\hypertarget{method}{%
\section{Method}\label{method}}

\hypertarget{corpora}{%
\subsection{Corpora}\label{corpora}}

We analyzed 8251 transcripts in the North American English collection of
the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) database (MacWhinney,
2000). The included transcripts were drawn from 52 individual corpora
and featured 980 children up to 7 years of age (range = 1--84 months,
\emph{M} = 33.5 months).

Additional data from the Language Development Project (LDP) longitudinal
corpus were also analyzed . These included XX transcripts from XX
children recorded every 4 months for approximately one hour from age 14
to 58 months.

\hypertarget{target-words}{%
\subsection{Target words}\label{target-words}}

Fifteen CDS/ADS word pairs (30 total target words) were selected based
on the appearance of at least one form on the MacArthur-Bates
Communicative Development Inventory (Fenson et al., 1994) and their
frequency of occurrence in CHILDES (at least 100 child-produced tokens
and 100 other-produced tokens per form; see Table \ref{tab:tab1}). Test
items were chosen such that the same object, animal, or routine could be
reasonably labeled with either form in the pair in typical communicative
interactions with young children (e.g., \emph{doggy} or \emph{dog}).

\hypertarget{linguistic-predictors}{%
\subsection{Linguistic predictors}\label{linguistic-predictors}}

All analyses were conducted over individual utterances. We quantified
prosodic, lexical, and syntactic information to describe each utterance
containing one of the 30 target words.

\hypertarget{prosodic-level}{%
\subsubsection{Prosodic level}\label{prosodic-level}}

We measured three types of prosodic information: mean pitch (Hz), pitch
range (Hz), and speaking rate (words per second). These measures were
calculated over all timestamped utterances in CHILDES (41.4\% of
child-produced and 42.3\% of other-produced utterances). Utterances
shorter than 58 ms were excluded from analysis. This lower bound was set
by identifying the the shortest possible duration of an utterance
containing at least one word in four manually annotated North American
English corpora in HomeBank (Bergelson, 2016; McDivitt \& Soderstrom,
2016; VanDam et al., 2016; VanDam, 2016; Warlaumont \& Pretzer, 2016).
Pitch information was extracted using Praat software (Boersma \&
Weenink, 2016).

\hypertarget{lexical-level}{%
\subsubsection{Lexical level}\label{lexical-level}}

We measured two types of lexical information: complexity and rarity.
Lexical complexity was defined as the negative log proportion of known
words in each utterance (consistent with Foushee, Griffiths, \&
Srinivasan, 2016; Kidd, Piantadosi, \& Aslin, 2012). A word was
considered `known' if the age of acquisition (AoA) estimate (Fenson et
al., 1994; Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky, \& Marchman, 2017) was less than
or equal to the age of the target child when they heard or produced the
utterance. Utterances with proportionally fewer known words are more
lexically complex. Lexical rarity was determined based on overall
frequency in CHILDES. For all words with at least XX tokens\footnote{Manual
  checks revealed that many or XX\% of the lowest-frequency words
  included idiosyncratic or erroneous transcriptions and/or repetitions
  of children's babbling.}, we calculated a rarity score as the negative
log proportion of other-produced tokens in CHILDES (i.e., number of
tokens for a given word/sum of all tokens in the full corpus), and then
averaged for rarity scores for all target utterances. Utterances with
more low-frequency words are considered more lexically rare. \newline

\hypertarget{syntactic-level}{%
\subsubsection{Syntactic level}\label{syntactic-level}}

Syntactic measures included both the length of the utterance (in words)
and the number of verb phrases. The number of words per utterance was
automatically extracted using the \texttt{childesr} package (Braginsky,
Sanchez, \& Yurovsky, 2021). The number of verb phrases per utterance
was determined using \texttt{spaCy3}, an automatic syntactic parser
(Honnibal, Montani, Van Landeghem, \& Boyd, 2020).

\subsection{Measuring production: When do children produce CDS vs.~ADS
forms?}\label{measuring-production-when-do-children-produce-cds-vs.-ads-forms}}

We first asked when CDS forms are replaced by ADS forms in children's
own speech. We fit mixed effects binomial logistic regression model
predicting children's production of CDS vs.~ADS forms with target child
age (in months) as a single fixed effect. Random slopes and intercepts
for individual word pairs and children were included.

\hypertarget{characterizing-the-input-in-what-linguistic-contexts-do-children-hear-cds-vs.-ads-forms}{%
\subsection{Characterizing the input: In what linguistic contexts do
children hear CDS vs.~ADS
forms?}\label{characterizing-the-input-in-what-linguistic-contexts-do-children-hear-cds-vs.-ads-forms}}

We used mixed-effects binomial logistic regression models to predict the
appearance of CDS vs.~ADS forms in given utterance on the basis of
target child's age, several linguistic properties of the utterance, and
interactions between each property and age. Models included random
slopes and intercepts for individual word pairs and speakers and were
fitted to all utterance data from speakers other than the target child.

Main effects and interactions with age are shown in Figure 2.
