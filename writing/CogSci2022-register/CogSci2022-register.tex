\begin{abstract}
Child-directed language (CDL) features words such as \emph{doggy},
\emph{night-night}, and \emph{tummy} that are rarely used in
adult-directed language (ADL). Characteristics of CDL word forms, such
as diminutivization and reduplication, explain why they may be learned
and produced earlier by children. However, it is not yet clear how or
when children `switch' to using ADL equivalents---\emph{dog},
\emph{goodnight}, \emph{stomach}. Through analysis of speech transcripts
from CHILDES and the Language Development Project corpus, we show that
children significantly increase their production of ADL word forms
across age, with the average CDL-to-ADL transition point at 2.5 years.
Many of the linguistic features that distinguish CDL vs.~ADL registers
(e.g., lexical and syntactic complexity) similarly differentiated the
local speech contexts surrounding CDL vs.~ADL word forms in children's
input, which is primarily CDL in these corpora. Learners may therefore
be able to capitalize on these linguistic cues to support their
discovery of register along with context-appropriate CDL/ADL pair use.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Across their first few years of life, children come to know hundreds if
not thousands of words (Fenson et al., 1994; Mayor \& Plunkett, 2011).
Word production typically begins around age one, followed by a
vocabulary `explosion' or `spurt' during toddlerhood (Ganger \& Brent,
2004; see also McMurray, 2007), and then continued, measurable increases
in vocabulary size thereafter (Rice \& Hoffman, 2015). Here, we
investigate one dimension of this dramatic developmental change: the
appearance and use of words from distinct registers.

Vocabulary first gets off the ground, in part, with words that are
specifically tailored to young learners (e.g., \emph{tummy}, Ferguson,
1964). Hallmark features of child-directed language (CDL), such as
iconicity (Laing, Vihman, \& Keren-Portnoy, 2017), diminutivization
(Kempe, Brooks, \& Gillis, 2005), and reduplication (Ota,
Davies-Jenkins, \& Skarabela, 2018) may support early word learning.
These effects are in addition to the cross-cutting influence of a word's
frequency, concreteness, length, and association with infancy on early
learnability (e.g., \emph{bottle} and \emph{bib}: Braginsky, Yurovsky,
Marchman, \& Frank, 2019; Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky, \& Marchman, 2017;
Perry, Perlman, Winter, Massaro, \& Lupyan, 2018).

While CDL-specific words (e.g., \emph{night-night}, \emph{doggy},
\emph{tummy}) are overrepresented in children's early vocabularies, they
are eventually replaced by ADL equivalents (\emph{goodnight},
\emph{dog}, \emph{stomach}). However, these words do not fully
disappear. Instead, they become designated for use in a specific
context---communication with infants and young children (e.g., Sachs \&
Devin, 1976; Shatz \& Gelman, 1973). The addition of a word like
\emph{stomach} to a children's vocabularies may mark their growing
awareness that word choice should be tailored to the current
interactional context (Clark, 1997, e.g., 2018). We do not, at present,
know when children begin to make shifts from CDL to ADL word use or
precisely how such a shift is supported or initiated. Our investigation
starts where this transition is most easily observed, with CDL/ADL word
pairs: (e.g., \emph{doggy/dog}, \emph{night-night/goodnight},
\emph{tummy/stomach}), as opposed to words that become less relevant
with time (e.g., \emph{diaper} and \emph{peekaboo}).

Classically, we might expect the appearance of both CDL and ADL labels
for the same referent to be a problem for early word
learning---particularly when the variants have little to no overlap in
phonological form (e.g., \emph{bunny/rabbit} vs.~\emph{doggy/dog}).
Indeed, children often assume that new labels refer to new items rather
than interpreting them as synonyms for words that they already know
(i.e., {``mutual exclusivity''}: Markman \& Wachtel, 1988; see Lewis,
Cristiano, Lake, Kwan, \& Frank, 2020, for a recent meta-analysis). Yet,
children seem to learn multiple CDL/ADL variants without issue.

One potential way to explain children's learning of both labels is to
consider the social context of CDL vs.~ADL use. While labeling an animal
as \emph{doggy} vs.~\emph{dog} may not communicate anything distinct
about the referent itself, the production of one form vs.~the other may
indicate something meaningful about \emph{who} is being addressed or
producing the label. That is, differences in register could serve to
`explain away' the otherwise problematic redundancy of multiple labels
in these pairs (Clark, 1990). Indirect evidence for this idea comes from
findings that the mutual exclusivity effect is modulated by children's
experience with multiple languages (Byers-Heinlein \& Werker, 2009;
Houston-Price, Caloghiris, \& Raviglione, 2010) and the social
conditions under which multiple labels are introduced (e.g., by speakers
of a familiar or unfamiliar race: Weatherhead, Kandhadai, Hall, \&
Werker, 2021). Further, children's speech to younger children (Sachs \&
Devin, 1976; Shatz \& Gelman, 1973) and their awareness of socially
meaningful linguistic variation (Ikeda, Kobayashi, \& Itakura, 2018;
Liberman, Woodward, \& Kinzler, 2017; Soley \& Sebastian-Galles, 2020)
suggests that they recognize the importance of social context for
language use from relatively early on.

We hypothesize that children may contend with CDL/ADL word pairs by
associating the contrasting forms with different modes of use (i.e., by
classifying each form as belonging to a distinct register). To test this
idea, we first need to establish (a) when children begin to shift away
from producing CDL-specific words, and (b) how children may be able to
use bottom-up linguistic input cues to associate lexical variants with
their associated registers (i.e., CDL vs.~ADL).

\hypertarget{current-investigation}{%
\subsection{Current investigation}\label{current-investigation}}

We examine a small but core subset of 15 CDL-specific words in English
(e.g., \emph{doggy}, \emph{night-night}, \emph{tummy}) that are
prevalent in children's early vocabularies but are eventually replaced
by ADL words---\emph{dog}, \emph{goodnight}, \emph{stomach}. In Study 1,
we analyze over 60,000 utterances of spontaneous speech from children up
to seven years of age to establish when ADL forms become more dominant
in children's own productions. That is, when do children switch from
using CDL forms to using ADL forms? Our data suggest that the average
age of `CDL-to-ADL switchover' occurs around 2.5 years.

We then explore the features of children's input that could support this
switch by examining the extent to which CDL and ADL words are used in
distinct linguistic contexts by adults. Further processing of nearly
70,000 non-target-child utterances (primarily from adult caregivers and
addressed to the target child) revealed that CDL and ADL variants
co-occur with reliably different patterns of prosodic, lexical, and
syntactic information---cues that likely help learners associate them
with different modes of use, or emerging representations of register.

Together, these studies push us to consider children's vocabulary
development not as a simple accumulation of words or numeric increase in
vocabulary size but rather a deepening and restructuring of the lexicon
with growing linguistic and social maturity. The words \emph{dog} and
\emph{stomach} do not entirely replace \emph{doggy} and
\emph{tummy}---rather, the contrasting forms become reserved for use
with different addressees.

\section{Study 1: When do children shift from CDL to ADL
forms?}\label{study-1-when-do-children-shift-from-cdl-to-adl-forms}}

We tracked children's use of 15 CDL/ADL word pairs (Table 1) from early
infancy up to age seven. Since CDL forms rarely appear in ADL, we
predicted that children would shift away from production of these
CDL-specific forms with increasing age. That is, we expected to see
replacement of CDL forms with ADL forms in children's own speech across
time.

\hypertarget{method}{%
\section{Method}\label{method}}

\hypertarget{corpora}{%
\subsection{Corpora}\label{corpora}}

We analyzed 8,251 transcripts in the North American English collection
of the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) database
(MacWhinney, 2000) for children up to 7 years of age. The included
transcripts were drawn from 52 individual corpora and featured 980
children (age range = 1--84 months, \emph{M} = 33.5 months). To further
gain purchase on our research question with \emph{longitudinal} data, we
also analyzed child production data from the Language Development
Project (LDP) corpus (see Huttenlocher, Waterfall, Vasilyeva, Vevea, \&
Hedges, 2010; Rowe, 2008, for further details regarding participating
families, recording procedures, and transcription). LDP data included
622 transcripts from 59 English-learning children recorded every 4
months for approximately 90 minutes from age 14 to 58 months.

\hypertarget{target-words}{%
\subsection{Target words}\label{target-words}}

Fifteen CDL/ADL word pairs (30 total target words) were selected based
on two criteria: the appearance of at least one form on the
MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI, Fenson et al.,
1994), and sufficient frequency of occurrence in CHILDES (at least 100
child-produced tokens and 100 other-produced tokens per form). Pairs
were also selected based on our own subjective judgment that the same
object, animal, routine, or body part could be reasonably labeled with
either form by young children.\footnote{While onomatopoeic words can be
  used in a similar manner to the CDL-specific words in our test set
  (e.g., \emph{choo-choo} serving as a CDL-specific label for
  \emph{train}, or \emph{quack-quack} for \emph{duck}), these iconic
  items were not included because they are primarily used as sound
  effects rather than labels for objects or animals (Skarabela, Pool, \&
  Ota, 2018). The polysemous nature of iconic word usage does not
  provide as clear of a test of replacement of CDL forms with ADL forms
  over time.} Across all transcripts, 64,852 child-produced utterances
contained at least one target word and were included in our analysis.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

We asked when CDL forms are replaced by ADL forms in children's own
speech. Using the \emph{lme4} package (version 1.1.27.1: Bates, Mächler,
Bolker, \& Walker, 2015) in R (version 4.1.0: R Core Team, 2021), we fit
a mixed-effects binomial logistic regression model predicting children's
production of CDL vs.~ADL forms, with target child age (in months,
scaled) as a single fixed effect. Random slopes and intercepts for word
pairs were also included\footnote{glmer(form \(\sim\) age (months,
  scaled) + (1 + age \textbar{} word pair), family = binomial)}. For
each target word token, the form was coded as either 0 (CDL) or 1 (ADL).
Thus, the model captures, for each age, the probability of using ADL
forms over CDL forms.

Children significantly increased their production of ADL forms over age
(\(\beta\) = 0.54, \emph{SE} = 0.11, \emph{t} = 4.92, \emph{p}
\textless{} 0.001). The average CDL-to-ADL transition point (i.e., the
point at which ADL forms were produced \textgreater50\% of the time) was
at approximately 28 months (i.e., around 2.5 years; Figure 1).

The trend of increasing ADL form production was significant for 13 of 15
word pairs, but the exact trajectory of shift varied greatly across
items (Figure 2). In some cases, CDL forms were replaced by ADL forms
early on (e.g., \emph{doggy/dog} and \emph{kitty/cat} around 2 years).
For other pairs, the age of CDL-to-ADL switch was much later (e.g.,
\emph{tummy/stomach} and \emph{potty/bathroom} around 5 years). Finally,
a clear point of switchover was not observed for some pairs because ADL
forms were already produced \textgreater50\% of the time from the
earliest ages sampled (e.g., \emph{duckie/duck} and
\emph{blankie/blanket}).

To further examine the robustness of the overall effect of increasing
ADL form production over age, we ran subset analyses on all CHILDES
transcripts (primarily cross-sectional, with hundreds of children), all
LDP transcripts (longitudinal, \emph{n} = 59, age range = 14--58
months), and all transcripts from the Providence corpus, a small,
longitudinal subset of CHILDES (\emph{n} = 6, age range = 11--48 months:
Demuth, Culbertson, \& Alter, 2006). The main finding was replicated in
all three subsets. Children significantly increased their production of
ADL forms over age collectively across all CHILDES corpora (\(\beta\) =
0.55, \emph{SE} = 0.11, \emph{t} = 4.95, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001), as
well as in LDP corpus (\(\beta\) = 0.38, \emph{SE} = 0.04, \emph{t} =
8.61, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001) and Providence corpus (\(\beta\) =
0.45, \emph{SE} = 0.14, \emph{t} = 3.23, \emph{p} = 0.001).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Analysis of children's own spontaneous speech revealed developmental
shifts in their production of CDL vs.~ADL forms, with the latter
becoming increasingly more prominent over age. While we found
substantial variation in the exact trajectories of CDL-to-ADL vocabulary
shift for the 15 word pairs, the overall trend towards ADL production
was clear. We take children's shifts away from CDL forms and towards ADL
forms as indirect evidence of their early formation of CDL and ADL as
distinct registers.

\hypertarget{study-2-what-linguisitc-information-in-childrens-input-supports-their-shift-from-cdl-to-adl-forms}{%
\section{Study 2: What linguisitc information in children's input
supports their shift from CDL to ADL
forms?}\label{study-2-what-linguisitc-information-in-childrens-input-supports-their-shift-from-cdl-to-adl-forms}}

We next explored children's input (i.e., other-produced speech), asking
what linguistic information could support their shift from CDL to ADL
forms. We conceptualize our second study as an investigation of the cues
that could help learners associate CDL and ADL words with their
appropriate registers.

CDL, as a register, is differentiated from ADL at multiple linguistic
levels, including prosodic, lexical, and syntactic differentiations
(e.g., Soderstrom, 2007). In English, CDL is associated with higher
overall pitch as well as greater variability in pitch contours (Fernald,
1989; Vosoughi \& Roy, 2012). CDL utterances are often produced more
slowly (Ko \& Soderstrom, 2013; e.g., Vigliocco, Shi, Gu, \& Grzyb,
2020; but see also Martin, Igarashi, Jincho, \& Mazuka, 2016). CDL also
typically includes less lexical diversity (Hills, 2013) and more words
that children already know (Foushee, Griffiths, \& Srinivasan, 2016).
Syntactically, CDL is characterized as less complex than ADL. CDL
utterances are typically shorter (Brent \& Siskind, 2001; Martin,
Igarashi, Jincho, \& Mazuka, 2016) and feature simpler constructions
(Cameron-Faulkner, Lieven, \& Tomasello, 2003).

Here, we tested whether the linguistic features that differentiate CDL
vs.~ADL at the register level also differentiate the local speech
contexts surrounding CDL vs.~ADL forms---even in speech that is
primarily addressed to children from their adult caregivers (i.e.,
language from a single register). In other words, can form be predicted
on the basis of individual utterance-level prosodic, lexical, or
syntactic cues?

We hypothesized that utterances with CDL forms, relative to utterances
with ADL forms, would be associated with (1) higher mean pitch, (2)
greater pitch variability, (3) slower speaking rates, and (4) less
lexical complexity. We also predicted that CDL utterances would contain
(5) fewer rare words, (6) fewer words overall, and (7) fewer verb
phrases. If these linguistic cues reliably differentiate CDL vs.~ADL
word usage contexts, then they could provide a viable source of
information to support children's association between these words and
their corresponding registers.

\hypertarget{corpora-1}{%
\subsection{Corpora}\label{corpora-1}}

We analyzed 69,709 other-produced utterances (i.e., utterances not
produced by the target child) in the same CHILDES transcripts from Study
1. The majority of utterances were produced by children's primary
caregivers (\emph{n} = 58,071, or 83.3\%). While, by and large, the
utterances are not annotated for addressee, our manual scanning of the
CHILDES corpora suggested that the vast majority of this speech is
addressed to the target child. Study 2 analyses exclude the LDP corpus
because it is not comprehensively timestamped.

\hypertarget{linguistic-input-predictors}{%
\subsection{Linguistic input
predictors}\label{linguistic-input-predictors}}

All input analyses were conducted over individual utterances containing
at least one of the 30 target words from Study 1. We quantified
prosodic, lexical, and syntactic information to describe each utterance.

\hypertarget{prosodic-level}{%
\subsubsection{Prosodic level}\label{prosodic-level}}

We measured three types of prosodic information: \textbf{mean pitch}
(Hz), \textbf{pitch range} (Hz), and \textbf{speech rate} (words per
second). These measures were calculated over all timestamped utterances
in CHILDES (42.3\% of other-produced utterances). Utterances shorter
than 58 ms were excluded from analysis.\^{}{[}This lower bound was set
by identifying the the shortest possible duration of an utterance
containing at least one word in four manually annotated North American
English corpora (see Bergelson et al., 2019 for details) Pitch
information was extracted using Praat software (Boersma \& Weenink,
2016).

\hypertarget{lexical-level}{%
\subsubsection{Lexical level}\label{lexical-level}}

We measured two types of lexical information: complexity and rarity.
\textbf{Lexical complexity} was defined as the negative log proportion
of known words in each utterance (consistent with Foushee, Griffiths, \&
Srinivasan, 2016; Kidd, Piantadosi, \& Aslin, 2012). A word was
considered `known' if the age of acquisition (AoA) estimate (Fenson et
al., 1994; Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky, \& Marchman, 2017) was less than
or equal to the age of the target child when they heard the utterance.
Utterances with proportionally fewer known words are considered more
lexically complex. \textbf{Lexical rarity} was determined based on
overall frequency in CHILDES. For all words with at least 10
tokens\footnote{Manual checks revealed that many of the lowest-frequency
  words in CHILDES included idiosyncratic or erroneous transcriptions,
  so we excluded words with fewer than 10 tokens from our estimates of
  lexical rarity to reduce noise in this measure.}, we calculated a
rarity score as the negative log proportion of other-produced tokens in
CHILDES (i.e., number of tokens for a given word divided by the sum of
all tokens of all words in the full corpus). We then averaged the rarity
scores for all individual words in a given target utterance. Utterances
with more low-frequency words are considered more lexically rare.

\hypertarget{syntactic-level}{%
\subsubsection{Syntactic level}\label{syntactic-level}}

Syntactic measures included both the utterance \textbf{length} (in
words) and \textbf{number of verb phrases}. The number of words per
utterance was automatically extracted using the \emph{childesr} package
(Braginsky, Sanchez, \& Yurovsky, 2021). The number of verb phrases per
utterance was determined using \emph{spaCy3}, an automatic syntactic
parser (Honnibal, Montani, Van Landeghem, \& Boyd, 2020).

\hypertarget{results-1}{%
\section{Results}\label{results-1}}

We ran individual mixed-effects binomial logistic regression models of
ADL or CDL word form use for each of seven linguistic input predictors.
Models included fixed effects of linguistic predictor (scaled), target
child age (in months, scaled), and their interaction as well as random
intercepts for individual word pairs and speakers\footnote{glmer(form
  \(\sim\) linguistic predictor (numeric, scaled) * age (months, scaled)
  + (1 \textbar{} word pair) + (1 \textbar{} speaker), family =
  binomial)}. For each target word token, the form was coded as CDL (0)
or ADL (1), so coefficient estimates provide a measure of the strength
of association between a predictor and ADL form. All main effects of
linguistic predictors and interactions with age are shown in Figure 3.
All models also showed a positive main effect of target child age (all
\emph{p}s \textless{} 0.001), confirming that adults increase ADL form
production as child addressees get older.

At the prosodic level, we found significant effects for two of the three
input predictors tested. Utterance-level \textbf{pitch range} was not
predictive of form (\(\beta\) = 0.002, \emph{SE} = 0.02, \emph{t} =
0.10, \emph{p} = 0.919) and did not significantly interact with age
(\(\beta\) = 0.02, \emph{SE} = 0.02, \emph{t} = 1.11, \emph{p} = 0.268).
However, utterance-level \textbf{mean pitch} was a negative predictor of
ADL form (\(\beta\) = -0.058, \emph{SE} = 0.02, \emph{t} = -3.02,
\emph{p} = 0.003). That is, utterances with higher overall mean pitch
were more likely to contain CDL forms, with no significant interaction
with age (\(\beta\) = -0.02, \emph{SE} = 0.02, \emph{t} = -0.96,
\emph{p} = 0.337). \textbf{Speech rate} (i.e., words produced per
second) was a positive predictor of ADL form (\(\beta\) = 0.09,
\emph{SE} = 0.02, \emph{t} = 4.86, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001).
Utterances spoken more quickly were more likely to contain ADL forms.
This input predictor also negatively interacted with age (\(\beta\) =
-0.07, \emph{SE} = 0.02, \emph{t} = -3.96, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001),
indicating a decreasing strength in predictive power across
developmental time.

At the lexical level, we found significant effects for both input
predictors tested. Utterances with higher levels of \textbf{lexical
complexity} (\(\beta\) = 0.27, \emph{SE} = 0.08, \emph{t} = 3.28,
\emph{p} = 0.001) and \textbf{lexical rarity} (\(\beta\) = 0.07,
\emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t} = 5.73, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001) were more
likely to contain ADL forms. Lexical complexity did not interact with
age (\(\beta\) = -0.10, \emph{SE} = 0.21, \emph{t} = -0.47, \emph{p} =
0.637); whereas, lexical rarity negatively interacted with age such that
there was a decreasing effect of this predictor over time (\(\beta\) =
-0.05, \emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t} = -3.95, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001).

At the syntactic level, we found significant effects of
\textbf{utterance length} and \textbf{number of verb phrases}.
Utterances with more words (\(\beta\) = 0.19, \emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t}
= 16.30, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001) and more verb phrases (\(\beta\) =
0.05, \emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t} = 4.44, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001)
were more likely to contain ADL forms. Moreover, both linguistic
predictors negatively interacted with age (Length: \(\beta\) = -0.16,
\emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t} = -14.61, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001; Verbs:
\(\beta\) = -0.08, \emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t} = -7.70, \emph{p}
\textless{} 0.001), suggesting that the strength of these predictors
decreases across developmental time.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}}

Analyses of children's input revealed reliable differences in the
patterns of linguistic information surrounding CDL vs.~ADL forms. Many
of the prosodic, lexical, and syntactic features that broadly
differentiate CDL vs.~ADL registers similarly partitioned utterances
containing CDL vs.~ADL forms. Notably, these differences in local speech
context emerged even in language that was primarily addressed to
children from their primary caregivers (i.e., language likely from a
single register---CDL). This finding underscores the idea that register
production reflects stylistic linguistic choices by the person producing
the utterance and does not necessarily require the prototypical
communicative context (e.g., a caregiver can use ADL-like utterances
when talking to a young child).

While we do not yet know if these linguistic cues are actually exploited
by learners, this study identifies which patterns appear learnable in
principle. More broadly, this work provides support for the possibility
that associations with CDL vs.~ADL registers are helping learners grasp
the differences in the context of CDL vs.~ADL form use and gradually
transition away from use of more contextually-constrained CDL-specific
words. A next step is to experimentally test how well children across
this age range perceive words as CDL or ADL relevant given the
surrounding linguistic context.

\hypertarget{general-discussion}{%
\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}}

In the current work, we establish that children shift away from
production of CDL-specific words over age. As predicted, these
child-centric words are `replaced' by ADL equivalents---at least until
they again become relevant when talking to younger children. Further, we
identify patterns in children's linguistic input that could support
their discovery of associations between CDL/ADL words and their typical
modes of use (i.e., incipient representations of register).

\subsection{More than vocabulary size: Understanding words and using
them in
context}\label{more-than-vocabulary-size-understanding-words-and-using-them-in-context}}

By analyzing spontaneous language production in the present study, we
find variation in form that is often overlooked but may be crucial for
understanding how vocabularies develop. Popular caregiver-reported
(Fenson et al., 1994) and researcher-administered (Dunn \& Dunn, 1965)
vocabulary measures typically ask for a binary indication of whether a
child `knows' a word. For good reason, these surveys and tests often
gloss over variations in form. This standardization helps with
generalizing over many idiosyncracies, allowing for large-scale, even
cross-linguistic comparisons (e.g., Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky, \&
Marchman, 2017, 2021). At the same time, glossing over variations in
form presents a missed opportunity to investigate more nuanced aspects
of vocabulary development. The present findings on the transition
between CDL and ADL forms help demonstrate that vocabulary development
taps into other major aspects of children's language learning, including
their socialization as users of the language in their community.

\hypertarget{developing-linguistic-and-social-knowledge-in-tandem}{%
\subsection{Developing linguistic and social knowledge in
tandem}\label{developing-linguistic-and-social-knowledge-in-tandem}}

Children's linguistic knowledge builds around and together with their
social knowledge. The lexical variants of CDL vs.~ADL registers are just
one example of socially meaningful linguistic variation in children's
input. Variation also appears across languages, dialects, accents, and
other types of registers (e.g., pedagogical, narrative, etc.). Over
time, children become increasingly aware of the fact that language style
is modulated by a variety of social factors, including the identities of
speakers (e.g., from different social groups: Liberman, Woodward, \&
Kinzler, 2017) along with their addressees (e.g., young children
vs.~adults: Ikeda, Kobayashi, \& Itakura, 2018; Soley \&
Sebastian-Galles, 2020). Children may therefore be able to leverage this
social knowledge when learning language (and vice versa).

We focus here on multiple labels for the same referent, but learners
also face the inverse problem: one label for different referents (e.g.,
Casey, Potter, Lew-Williams, \& Wojcik, 2021; Meylan, Mankewitz, Floyd,
Rabagliati, \& Srinivasan, 2021). We see these puzzles of word learning
as interrelated; learning is happening at multiple levels---not just the
words themselves, but strong associations between words and their
surrounding contexts (linguistic, social, etc.). Considering the
interaction between these different factors can help us reason about
learning mechanisms and children's representations---again not just of
words but related social information too.
