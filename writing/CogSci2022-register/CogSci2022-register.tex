\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Child-directed speech (CDS) features words such as \emph{doggy},
\emph{night-night}, and \emph{tummy} that are rarely used in
adult-directed speech (ADS). Characterisitcs of CDS word forms, such as
reduplication and diminutivization, explain why they may be learned and
produced earlier by children. However, it is not yet clear how or when
children switch to using ADS equivalents---\emph{dog}, \emph{goodnight},
\emph{stomach}. Through analysis of transcripts from CHILDES and the
Language Development Project corpus, we show that children significantly
increase their production of ADS word forms across age, with the average
CDS-to-ADS transition point at 2.5 years. Many of the linguistic
features that distinguish CDS vs.~ADS registers (e.g., speech rate,
lexical complexity, etc.) similarly differentiate the local speech
contexts surrounding CDS vs.~ADS word forms. To test whether these
patterns in children's input\ldots classifier details\ldots Learners may
therefore be able to capitalize on these cues to support their discovery
of context-appropriate CDS/ADS pair use.

\item
  CDS overview - beneficial for learning and x, y, z features
\item
  Then register-specific words One characteristic feature of CDS is the
  presence of register-specific words, such as \emph{doggy},
  \emph{night-night}, and \emph{tummy}.
\item
  Then relationship to social/contextual information Infants as young as
  12 months show an emerging understanding of the relationship between
  registers and addressees (\textbf{soley2020infants?}). That is,
  infants hear CDS and adults hear ADS.
\end{enumerate}

Word learners are not just determining what any given word means but
also when it's

After establishing that a shift in children's productions occurs in
early childhood, we next explored what information in their linguistic
input could support this shift.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{corpora}{%
\subsection{Corpora}\label{corpora}}

We analyzed 8251 transcripts in the North American English collection of
the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) database (MacWhinney,
2000). The included transcripts were drawn from 52 individual corpora
and featured 980 children up to 7 years of age (range = 1--84 months,
\emph{M} = 33.5 months).

Additional transcripts from the Language Development Project (LDP)
longitudinal corpus were also analyzed. These included XX transcripts
from XX children recorded every X months for approximately one hour from
age X to XX months.

\hypertarget{target-words}{%
\subsection{Target words}\label{target-words}}

Fifteen CDS/ADS word pairs (30 total target words) were selected based
on their appearance on the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development
Inventory (Fenson et al., 1994) and their frequency of occurrence in
CHILDES (at least 100 child-produced tokens and 100 other-produced
tokens; see Table \ref{tab:tab1}). Test items were chosen such that the
same object, animal, or routine could be reasonably labeled with either
word in a given pair in typical communicative interactions with young
children (e.g., \emph{doggy} or \emph{dog}).

\hypertarget{linguistic-predictors}{%
\subsection{Linguistic predictors}\label{linguistic-predictors}}

All analyses were conducted over individual utterances. We quantified
prosodic, lexical and syntactic information to describe each utterance
containing one of the 30 target words.

\hypertarget{prosodic-level}{%
\subsubsection{Prosodic level}\label{prosodic-level}}

We measured three types of prosodic information: mean pitch (Hz), pitch
range (Hz), and speaking rate (words per second). These measures were
calculated over all timestamped utterances in CHILDES (41.4\% of
child-produced and 42.3\% of other-produced utterances). Utterances
shorter than 58 ms were excluded from analysis. This lower bound was set
by identifying the the shortest possible duration of an utterance
containing at least one word in four manually annotated North American
English corpora in HomeBank (Bergelson, 2016; McDivitt \& Soderstrom,
2016; VanDam et al., 2016; VanDam, 2016; Warlaumont \& Pretzer, 2016).
Pitch information was extracted using Praat software (Boersma \&
Weenink, 2016).

\hypertarget{lexical-level}{%
\subsubsection{Lexical level}\label{lexical-level}}

We measured two types of lexical information: complexity and rarity.
Lexical complexity was defined as the negative log proportion of known
words in each utterance (consistent with Foushee, Griffiths, \&
Srinivasan, 2016; Kidd, Piantadosi, \& Aslin, 2012). A word was
considered `known' if the age of acquisition (AoA) estimate (Fenson et
al., 1994; Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky, \& Marchman, 2017) was less than
or equal to the age of the target child when they heard or produced the
utterance. Utterances with proportionally fewer known words are more
lexically complex. Rare words were determined based on overall CHILDES
frequency. The rarest words have the lowest frequency. We calculated the
average frequency for the words in each utterance that appeared at least
one other time in the full corpus.

\hypertarget{syntactic-level}{%
\subsubsection{Syntactic level}\label{syntactic-level}}

Syntactic measures included both the length of the utterance (in words)
and the number of verb phrases. The number of words per utterance was
automatically extracted using the \texttt{childesr} package (Braginsky,
Sanchez, \& Yurovsky, 2021). The number of verb phrases per utterance
was determined using \texttt{spaCy3}, an automatic syntactic parser
(Honnibal, Montani, Van Landeghem, \& Boyd, 2020).

\subsection{Measuring production: When do children produce CDS vs.~ADS
forms?}\label{measuring-production-when-do-children-produce-cds-vs.-ads-forms}}

We first asked when CDS forms are replaced by ADS forms in children's
own speech. We fit mixed effects binomial logistic regression model
predicting children's production of CDS vs.~ADS forms with target child
age (in months) as a single fixed effect. Random slopes and intercepts
for individual word pairs and children were included.

\hypertarget{characterizing-the-input-in-what-linguistic-contexts-do-children-hear-cds-vs.-ads-forms}{%
\subsection{Characterizing the input: In what linguistic contexts do
children hear CDS vs.~ADS
forms?}\label{characterizing-the-input-in-what-linguistic-contexts-do-children-hear-cds-vs.-ads-forms}}

We used mixed-effects binomial logistic regression models to predict the
appearance of CDS vs.~ADS forms in given utterance on the basis of
target child's age, several linguistic properties of the utterance, and
interactions between each property and age. Models included random
intercepts for individual word pairs and speakers and were fitted to all
utterance data from speakers other than the target child.

Main effects and interactions with age are shown in Figure

\caption[Coefficient estimates for linguistic predictors of form]{Coefficient estimates for linguistic predictors of form. Positive main effects indicate that utterances are more likely to contain ADS forms when they have higher values for the predictor (e.g., faster speech rates). Positive age interactions indicate an increasing effect of the predictor with age. Error bars depict standard errors of the coefficient estimates, and filled circles represent significant effects (\textit{p} $<$ 0.05).}\label{fig:model-plot}
